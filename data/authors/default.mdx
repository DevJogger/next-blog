ðŸ‘‹, I am Jerry, now living in Vancouver ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

I am a full-stack developer, a 3D printing enthusiast, an AI prompt engineer, a smart home aficionado, a photographer, a sim racing player, and a fan of the NFL, F1, and EPL.

I have a huge passion for using code to build solutions for real-life problems. I always love learning new things, from software to hardware.

In my free time, you can find me exploring the latest in technology, creating all sorts of fun and interesting objects with my 3D printer, or capturing moments through my lens. I thrive on the excitement of discovering innovative ways to integrate smart home devices.

I enjoy the thrill of sim racing competitions, and I am also drawn to the NFL, F1, and EPL because they embody the essence of teamwork, with each player contributing their unique skills to enhance the team's overall performance. My diverse interests and relentless curiosity drive me to constantly evolve and stay ahead in this ever-changing digital world.
