ðŸ‘‹, I am Jerry, now living in Vancouver ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

I am a full-time web developer, a husband, a father of two kids.

I have a huge passion for using codes to build solutions for real-life problems. I always love learning new things, from software to hardware.

I have countless hobbies. Recently I play with my 3D printer and AI image generator Stable Diffusion.
